# Scaled-down Electrostatic Precipitator for HVAC Duct Cleaning

**Project Title**: Scaled-down Electrostatic Precipitator for Duct Cleaning of HVAC Systems  
**Institution**: University of Moratuwa

In Semester 3, I collaborated with team members Kimali and Kaviru to design an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) aimed at improving air quality in HVAC ducts. The system captures dust and particulate matter using electrostatic forces, significantly enhancing the cleanliness of air circulated through these systems.

## Project Overview

This project involved the development of a comprehensive simulation model for an innovative ESP system integrated into HVAC ducts. Key features of the system include:

- **Voltage Control Mechanisms**: The system operates at 1.5 kV to achieve a 99% efficiency rate in dust and particulate matter removal.
- **Robotic Arm Integration**: A robotic arm was incorporated for enhanced dust removal within the ducts.
- **Dynamic Control**: The system dynamically controls the electrostatic charge and airflow to optimize performance in various HVAC environments.

The ESP system is designed to improve indoor air quality by effectively capturing airborne particles, making it suitable for use in industrial, commercial, and residential HVAC systems.

## Key Contributions

- **MATLAB Simulations**: I led the development of MATLAB simulations to model the behavior of the vacuum system and fan dynamics. These simulations were critical in analyzing and optimizing the system's performance.
- **Documentation**: I was responsible for documenting the system design and operational performance. This included the creation of detailed technical reports and user manuals to guide the development and operation of the system.

## Skills and Tools Used

- **MATLAB**: Simulation and modeling of the vacuum system and fan behavior.
- **Simulink**: For simulating system dynamics and airflow control.
- **SOLIDWORKS**: 3D modeling of the ESP and HVAC duct components.
- **COMSOL Multiphysics**: Simulation of electrostatic forces and particle dynamics.
- **Overleaf**: For creating technical reports and user manuals collaboratively.
